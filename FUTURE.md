# FUTURE — the v2 parking lot

Ideas deliberately **not** planned: analysed enough to record, parked without commitment. This is
not PLAN.md — nothing here has a phase or a checkbox, and nothing here is promised. When an idea
graduates, it moves to PLAN and this file keeps a one-line pointer. Each entry carries the date of
its analysis and the facts its numbers depend on — check both before trusting an old entry, and
grep HISTORY before re-arguing anything an entry says was already decided.

## GDAL 3.13 — assessed and SKIPPED (analysed 2026-07-23)

- **State at analysis:** system CLI 3.12.2 (Ubuntu 26.04 archive — the LTS will stay there);
  rasterio 1.5.0 bundling GDAL 3.12.1 on the Python side; CI on the runner's distro gdal-bin;
  no pipeline container yet.
- **Possible:** mechanically yes, but only via source build / PPA / the OSGeo container images —
  and rasterio can't follow until a wheel bundles 3.13, so a CLI-only upgrade widens today's
  benign 3.12.1/3.12.2 split. All listed 3.13 breaking changes are C/C++-API-side; our
  CLI + rasterio surface is untouched (the `--src/--dst` → `--input/--output` rename keeps old
  names).
- **Useful: no.** The one headline naming our tool — `gdal raster tile` automatic source
  *overview* selection — doesn't apply (our design deliberately has no overviews; low zooms
  build from the tiles). Everything else on our surface is a no-op. Two items are mild *risk*:
  the warper Lanczos special-case removal and "RasterIO resampling now operates in output buffer
  type by default" — resampling changes shift output **bytes**, our pyramid is ratified by
  byte-compare, and the freshness guard is version-blind → an upgrade mid-stream risks a
  mixed-generation pyramid.
- **Revisit when:** (a) a full-restage boundary arrives (the Phase 5 supersampled re-fuse
  regenerates every byte, making version drift moot) AND (b) rasterio bundles 3.13+.
- **Actionable now (Phase 4, not deferred):** when the rohome pipeline container gets built, pin
  its GDAL to 3.12.x to match dev — the same-version principle matters more than the number.

## Look presets — user-selectable globe styles (analysed 2026-07-23)

- **Trigger:** could users pick looks — default, every-country-coloured, seasonal variants (the
  St. Patrick's green-sea example)?
- **Numbers depend on:** the z0–8 pyramid ≈ 15–16 GB and ~87k tiles per look; composite-stage
  restage ~29 min (PROCESS § what a change costs); `countries.geojson` sub-pixel since the
  hover-outline fix (HISTORY § the blocky hover outline).

Presets decompose into **three kinds by where the variation lives** — costs differ by orders of
magnitude, so the taxonomy is the decision:

### Kind 1 — vector-over-raster (client-side, ~free) — the one to build first

- "Every-country-coloured" is this kind, **not** a raster look: country identity is vector data we
  already ship and already draw — the hover wash *is* this preset with one colour.
- Implementation: carry `MAPCOLOR13` through `countries_geojson.py` (`-select ADMIN,MAPCOLOR13` —
  Natural Earth pre-computes 7/8/9/13-colour schemes where neighbours never collide, verified
  present in our shapefile), a 13-colour palette tuned over the relief, a `fill` layer at
  ~0.25 opacity, a visibility toggle. Zero pipeline, zero storage, zero caps work.
- Same kind: border-style variants, maritime emphasis, label layers — data-driven styling on
  shipped vectors.
- A weekend feature, and it exercises the whole preset *system* (registry, picker, persistence)
  without touching the pipeline.

### Kind 2 — raster recolors (one PMTiles archive per look)

- Green sea, sepia, dark relief: the look is baked into pixels, so each look = its own archive.
  **Per look: ~33 min compute** (SVF + composite + cut + pack/convert + caps) **and +15 GB
  storage**; web swaps the `pmtiles://` URL + cap pair. Scales to a curated few, not to many.
- **One-time prerequisite: look parameterization (~a day).** Today every guardrail treats a second
  look as drift — correctly: `test_palette` pins `WATER_RGB` relationally (+7% of sea surface),
  palette is shared by import so editing it in place marks the heroes stale. Looks must become
  first-class: named looks in palette, `composite_params`/freshness/output dirs/cap recipes keyed
  by look, relational pins per-look. Corollary to remember: `LAKE_STOPS[0]` derives from
  `WATER_RGB`, so a naive green sea also greens every lake and river — a choice, not an accident.
- One-off stunt rungs, if a *single day* ever justifies a gag without the plumbing:
  `raster-hue-rotate` on the relief layer (free, but rotates land too, and our custom-layer caps
  ignore raster paint properties — they'd need a shader tint uniform), or a translucent green
  ocean `fill` veil (client-only, bathymetry shading survives underneath, reads as a veil not a
  repaint).

### Kind 3 — client-side colorization (looks become shader LUTs)

- Split colour from data: ship shading + masks as data channels (grayscale light, snow/ice/lake
  alphas — packable into one RGBA archive; elevation via the Phase 5 terrain-RGB archive) and
  apply ramps in a custom WebGL layer. Look N then costs a LUT, ~0 bytes.
- **The counterweight:** it reimplements `shade.composite` in GLSL — a twin look engine, i.e. the
  copy-drift disease at engine scale, in a codebase whose architecture exists to forbid exactly
  that. Only worth opening if presets prove popular enough to be a headline feature; it is a
  Phase-5-sized decision and pairs naturally with the terrain-RGB work if that ships.

### The preset system itself (needed for any kind)

- A **`presets.json` contract** emitted by the pipeline, fetched by the web (the `caps.json`
  pattern — pipeline facts never hand-copied into TypeScript).
- **UI + persistence** following existing precedents: localStorage like the quality/border
  toggles, shareable `?look=` param.
- **Scoping decision to make explicitly:** presets are a *globe* feature; heroes/gallery stay
  single-look (204 Cycles re-renders per preset is not a menu item).

### Recommendation ladder (as analysed)

- Kind 1 first, when wanted — cheap, complete, exercises the system.
- Kind 2 only when a specific second look earns its 15 GB; pay the parameterization day then.
- Kind 3 only if presets become a proven headline feature; decide alongside Phase 5 terrain-RGB.

## AVIF hero variants (analysed 2026-07-23)

- **Trigger:** the astro:assets audit during the 7.1.3 bump — the one genuine feature we forgo by
  bypassing it is AVIF format negotiation, and it belongs in *our* pipeline, not a second
  optimizer re-encoding ratified pixels (one encoder-quality owner).
- **Idea:** AVIF siblings of the existing rungs in `hero_variants.py` (WebP q85 today — France
  0.7 / 2.3 / 6.9 MB at 1920/3840/native); gallery + globe panel switch to `<picture>` with
  `type` fallback. Rule-of-thumb gain ~20–30% smaller at similar quality — **unmeasured on our
  content; measure 2–3 heroes before deciding anything.**
- **Costs to check at pickup:** GDAL AVIF driver present in our build (needs libavif); AVIF
  encode time × ~612 files (AVIF encoders are slow); variant store grows ~+70%; web markup
  change is small.
- **Natural decision point:** the Phase 4 Lighthouse pass, where transfer sizes get audited
  anyway. Not before.
